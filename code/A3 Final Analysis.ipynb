The reason is that most modern word embedding algorithms are inherently stochastic and the resulting embedding sets are invariant under rotation. Thus, even when trained on the same data, separate learning runs will produce entirely different numerical vectors (though with roughly the same pairwise similarities between vectors for particular words). This is expressed even stronger for models trained on different corpora.

The traditional approach which is to find $\\Omega$ that aligns the matrix of all the vectors for all the common words between A and B\n","2. Another approach which is to focus on aligning a smaller subset of words between A and B and using these as \"anchor points\" to align the two matrices.\n","    - In this case we will use stop words as \"anchor points\" then given the $\\Omega$ that aligns vectors of the stop words between A and B we will use this $\\Omega$ to align all the common words of A and B\n","    - To be able to do this we will use the transpose of $\\Omega$\n","    - My intuition for this approach is that it does not force words that are not meant to be aligned to align. By focusing on a small subset of words that we are sure to have not undergone a semantic shift this will not \"lose\" the shifts when we align the two matrices\n","\n","### Fixing the local neighborhood measure\n","\n","As of now there aren't any fixes for the results we obtained in the local neighborhood measure.
